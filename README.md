# SVG Logo Maker
Module 10 Challenge - SVG Logo Maker

In this challenge, I created an SVG Logo Maker. 
<ul>When prompted for text, the user can enter up to 3 characters.</ul>
<ul>When prompted for text color, the user can enter a color keyword or hex color.</ul>
<ul>When prompted for a shape, the user is presented with a list to choose from either a circle, triangle, or square.</ul>
<ul>When prompted for a shape color, the user can enter a color keyword or hex color.</ul>
<ul>When the user has entered inputs for all prompts, then an SVG file is created named 'logo.svg', and the output text 'Generated logo.svg' is printed in the command line.</ul>
<ul>When the user opens the 'logo.svg' file in a browser, then they are shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria they entered.</ul>
